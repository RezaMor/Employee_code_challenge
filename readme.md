## Installation

Command | Description
:------ | :----------
<pre>git clone <this repo></pre> | clones the current repository on your machine
<pre>npm install --global --production windows-build-tools</pre> | If you're using Windows you need to install all node-gyp dependencies with the following commands (NOTE: Run As Admininstrator in Windows PowerShell)
<pre>npm install --global node-gyp</pre> | install the gyp package
<pre>npm install</pre> | install the project and project dependencies
<pre>npm start</pre> | run the project
<pre>go to http://localhost:3000</pre> | **http://localhost:3000**
<pre>npm run test</pre> | runs all the unit test in the project (unit tests should be located in unitTest directries for each module

<!--[RM_DIR_STRUCTURE]-->
## Directory Structure

Code is organised into modules which contain one-or-more components. This a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
employee_register_code_challenge	/
 ├──config/                       * configuration files live here (e.g. webpack, docs/, testSystem/, testUnit/, testVisualRegression/, verify/)
 │
 ├──src/                          * source code files should be here
 │   └──modules/                  * all source code modules|components|features should appear as sub-directories under this directory
 │       ├──code-challenge/

### Introduction

We would like you to implement an Address Book for a Branch Manager that holds employee names, phone number and their department.

I want to be able to add a new employee (first name, last name, department and a single phone number).

* I want to be able to search for staff members by their department.

* I want to be able to search for staff members by name.

* I want to be able to delete an employee.

* I want the ability to sort all staff alphabetically by surname.

## Build Tasks

Command | Description
:------ | :----------
<pre>npm run build</pre> | Generate production build into [dist/](dist/) folder
<pre>npm run build:serve</pre> | Generate production build and serve on **http://localhost:3000**'
<pre>npm run dev</pre> | Run project in development mode (verify code, create dev build into dev/ folder, serve on **http://localhost:3000**, watch for changes and reload the browser automatically)
<pre>npm start</pre> | Alias for `npm run dev` task
<pre>npm run build:dev</pre> | Create a development build using Webpack<ul><li>Sourcemaps</li><li>Hot reloading of source code</li></ul>
<pre>npm run build:prod</pre> | Create a production build using Webpack<ul><li>Minifies source code</li><li>Sourcemaps</li><li>Dead code removal</li><li>Hashes added to file names for cache-busting</li></ul>

<!--[CN_TEST_TASKS]-->
## Test Tasks

Command | Description
:------ | :----------
<pre>npm test</pre> | Alias for `npm run test:unit` task
<pre>npm run test:coverage</pre> | Alias for test:unit:once, which also does test coverage checks and will fail if test coverage is not sufficient
<pre>npm run test:unit</pre> | Run unit tests whenever JS source or tests change<ul><li>Uses Karma and Jasmine 2</li><li>Code coverage</li><li>Runs continuously (best to run in a separate window)</li></ul>
<pre>npm run test:unit:debug</pre> | Run unit tests but disable code coverage to make debugging in a browser easier<ul><li>Runs continuously (best to run in a separate window)</li><li>No code coverage to make it easier to read source & testcode</li></ul>
<pre>npm run test:unit:once</pre> | Run unit tests once<ul><li>Tests are run a single time</li><li>Good command for continuous integration testing</li></ul>
<pre>npm run test:system</pre> | Run browser tests against the *development* web server (the development server **must** be running)
